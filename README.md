# EctoHash
*Scanning tool for Minecraft mods to check them against known cheats.*

## How?
Huge list of file hashes, my hope is that by making an open source list, people are able to contribute client hashes in order to make the tool more effective.
## This sounds terrible
I know, it was mostly me messing around with file hashes and I just came up with the idea on the spot.
## What does it detect?
Anything that is both in the folder specified and also in the `Hashes.json` file.
## Should this be used for screensharing?
Probably not, but I guess if there's enough hashes it could be viable. Screensharing is a terrible practice regardless and we need better solutions. But this is open source, do what you want with it.
